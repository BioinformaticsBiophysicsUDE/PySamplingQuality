### DESCRIPTION: ###
# 
# v08.09.16
# This function generates the plots "Overlap vs Threshold r" for conf/dens + the corresponding integral.
# - possibility to submit multiple OverlapMatrices to plot for instance multiple groups together
# - possibility to submit a second OverlapMatrix to compare a second molecule with its own x-axis
# - possibility to submit different X-limites to "normalize" the curves for instance on a certain threshold interval
# - all Groups from one OverlapList are used
# - XLIM1 & XLIM2 are used also for the integral limits
# 
##  ##  ##  ##  ##

# Directory, where the Overlap is located, e.g. 'Overlap/'
OverlapDir = "Overlap/"                 # <STRING> format example: (non-directory) "TEXT" | (directory) "TEXT/"
#-------------------------------------------
# List of Overlap filenames containing different cases, e.g. Pairs, different Groups, which are then plotted separately in one plot e.g. ['Overlap_ALLvsALL.txt' 'Overlap_AvsB.txt']

#-------------------------------------------
# <default None> second List, with same properties as OverlapList2, e.g. a second molecule to compare
OverlapList2 = "None"           # <LIST> format example: "Name1 Name2 Name3 Name4"

# <default ''> name to specify the first OverlapList1, e.g. 'Molecule1'

# <default [None]> Legend for the single elements of the OverlapList1, e.g. ['ALL','AvsB']
