### DESCRIPTION: ###
# 
# v17.10.16
# This function generates the plots 'Overlap vs simulation Time' for conformational & density overlap
# - possibility to submit multiple OverlapMatrices to plot for instance multiple groups together
# - each element of OverlapList MUST constain 'Start-End' which are replaced by the elements of SimTimeList, because
#   Overlap files are calculated for different simulation times separately and must be merged in first place
# - elements of SimTimeList define the (StartFrame, EndingFrame) tuples for the corresponding simulation time
# - all Groups from one OverlapList are used
#

#-------------------------------------------
# List of Overlap filenames containing different cases, e.g. Pairs, different Groups, MUST CONTAIN 'Start-End' which is replaced by the corresponding element of SimTimeList e.g. ['Overlap_ALLvsALL_Start-End.txt' 'Overlap_AvsB_Start-End.txt']
