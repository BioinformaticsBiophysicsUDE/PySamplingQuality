### DESCRIPTION: ###
#  
# v12.10.16
# - calculates <conformational overlap> and <density overlap> : Overlap between different trajectories/groups 
#   for different Threshold and reference Trajectories
# - CompareList has to match the TrajNr in the EventCurves: the overlap is than calculated between the sets of trajectory numbers defined in CompareList
# - EventNames can be splitted into different reference trajectories [_RowX] or different trajectories for which the 
#     Events are counted for [_ColX]
# - currently: (1) EventCurves with different reference trajectories [_RowX] are combined according to the submitted order
#                  of EventNames, e.g. = [EventCurve_Row1_2_3.npy, EventCurve_Row4_5_6.npy] are merged to one 
#                                        corresponding EventCurve containing all 6 reference TrajNrs
#              (2) EventCurves with different trajectories, for which the Events are counted for [_ColX] are ALSO merged, 
#                  defining (sorted) COL_TrajNrList (automatically by the EventNames name) 
#                      e.g. = [EventCurve_Col2_3.npy, EventCurve_Col3_52_65.npy] are merged to one _Col2_3_52_45
#                  -> COL_TrajNrList is detected by the EventNames automatically, 
#                     defining which column represents which trajectory (number)
