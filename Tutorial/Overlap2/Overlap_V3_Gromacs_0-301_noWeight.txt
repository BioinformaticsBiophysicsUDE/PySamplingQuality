# 	densO has to be averaged for different trajectory Nr projections
# 	confO means the number of frames which have at least 1 event for each trajectory group
# 	TotFrames means the total number of frames of the certain trajectory group
# 	confO and TotFrames have to be summed for different trajectory Nr projections
# 		and then divided to obtain the real conformational overlap value
# 	GroupNr monitors the number of the comparing group of [X]vs[Y]vs... meaning that
# 		the overlap value corresponds to the projection on the i-th group
# 		-1 means projection on all groups
